# Python
These are various homework assignments and projects that were done with Python.
# Web Scrapper
If you want to use my web scraper and don't have an IDE no worries, you can use Repel (https://repl.it/) which is IDE for your web browser. You'll also want to run: Beautifulsoup (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) and numpy (https://numpy.org/). Happy Scraping!
